Pointer-events: none; på mobilen fungerer ikke riktig på mobilen.*Fixed*

On PC Browser, when wider than 860px, it will still apply properties of .hideLogo from @media. Why the fuck? *Fixed*

31/jan

Concept looks good but needs adjustments:
- Value adjustment for screen compatibility
	- Font Size
	- positioning values
- Bottom of menucontents::before behaves weird on phone. play with inset values?
- Fine tuning to make it look cool'n shit

Alternative Solution: fill full screen width of menucontents::before and resize h1 & h2 a little with @media

18/Feb Today Momma's birthday yaaay <3
For some reason the only keyword that works correctly is "kylling", but it doesnt work on-load unless a tab has been selected.
i.e. Click the "Alle" tab before trying to search for a keyword.

*Fixed the "Wont load unless a tab has been selected" by assigning "selectedTab" global variable to "tab-all", however keywords other than "chicken" still isnt working as expected, why tf not?.

Theory why only "kylling" works as intended: because all input into the search-bar is converted into lowercase, therefore it wont find or resonate with any of the card.elements that have capital letters in them. How to solve this?
Todos:
- FIXED Solve for Above Theory (Tested its correct)
- Figure out how to add NodeElements of the Icons from json file
- Edit Pictures
- Complete list of items
- After release make code look nice and organized
